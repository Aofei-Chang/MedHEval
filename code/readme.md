## Baselines

- All the implementations are follow the original settings of the baselines.
- About more details, please refer to their official implementation via the links provided in our manuscript.
- All the scripts for model inference are under the folder "inference_scripts".



## Evaluation

We upload the code for open-ended evaluation using GPT-4.

The close-ended evaluation follows the existing benchmarks: https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/CARES/tree/main/src/eval



## Data_Generation

For data generation, we divided the generation code based on the data sources and hallucination types, as each source and type require a different processing method.
