## Baselines

- All implementations strictly adhere to the original settings of the respective baselines.
- For more details, please refer to the official implementations via the links provided in our manuscript, as outlined in Appendix.
- We include the original code for all evaluated LVLMs and mitigation baselines along with the corresponding inference scripts:
  - Available in the folder: `code/baselines/(Med)-LVLMs/`
  - Mitigation codes available in the folder: `code/baselines/mitigation/`
  - All model inference scripts can be found under the `inference_scripts` subfolder within each LVLM's directory.

## Evaluation

We provide the code for evaluation under folder: `code/evaluation/`, with a corresponding readme file.

------

## Data Generation

For data generation, the code is organized by data sources and hallucination types, as each source and type require distinct processing methods.

- Please find the relevant code in the folder: `code/data_generation`
